Question

P1 and P2 are two persons:
P1 thinks even numbers are lucky for him and randomly rolls a dice once and cuts a square from a sheet of paper with side value = value on dice only when there is an even number.
P2 who doesn't believe in luck however rolls the dice twice and cuts a rectangle with length as first roll value and breadth as second roll value.
1. On an average, what is the size of area end up cutting by each person?
2. Are they equal?
3. If not then who cuts the larger area and why? (Hint: structure the problem algorithmically)
